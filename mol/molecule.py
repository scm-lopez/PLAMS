class Molecule:
    """A class representing the molecule object.

    An instance of this class has the following attributes:

    *   ``atoms`` -- list of |Atom| objects that belong to the molecule
    *   ``bonds`` -- list of |Bond| objects between atoms listed in ``atoms``
    *   ``lattice`` -- list of lattice vectors in case of periodic structures
    *   ``properties`` -- |Settings| instance storing all other information about the molecule

    .. note::

        Each |Atom| in ``atoms`` list and each |Bond| in ``bonds`` list has a reference to the parent molecule. Moreover, each atom stores the list of bonds it's a part of and each bond stores references to atoms it bonds. That creates a complex net of references between objects that are part of a molecule. Consistency of this data is crucial for proper functioning of many methods. Because of that it is advised not to modify contents of ``atoms`` and ``bonds`` by hand. When you need to alter your molecule, methods :meth:`add_atom`, :meth:`delete_atom`, :meth:`add_bond` and :meth:`delete_bond` can be used to ensure that all these references are updated properly.

    Creating a |Molecule| object for your calculation can be done in two ways. You can start with an empty molecule and manually add all atoms (and bonds, if needed)::

        mol = Molecule()
        mol.add_atom(Atom(atnum=1, coords=(0,0,0)))
        mol.add_atom(Atom(atnum=1, coords=(d,0,0)))

    This approach can be useful for building small molecules, especially if you wish to parametrize some of atomic coordinates (like in :ref:`simple_example`), but in general it's not very practical. Usually one wants to import atomic coordinates from some external file::

        mol = Molecule('xyz/Benzene.xyz')

    The constructor of a |Molecule| object accepts four arguments that can be used to supply this information from a file in your filesystem. *filename* should be a string with a path (absolute or relative) to such a file. *inputformat* describes the format of the file. Currently, the following formats are supported: ``xyz``, ``mol``, ``mol2`` and ``pdb``. If *inputformat* is ``ase`` the file reader engine of the ASE.io module is used, enabling you to read all input formats supported by :ref:`ASEInterface`. See :meth:`read` for further details. If the *inputformat* argument is not supplied, PLAMS will try to deduce it by examining the extension of the provided file, so in most of cases it is not needed to use *inputformat*, if only the file has the proper extension. Some formats (``xyz`` and ``pdb``) allow to store more than one geometry of a particular molecule within a single file. See the respective :meth:`read` function for details how to access them. All *other* keyword arguments will be passed to the appropriate read function for the selected or determined file format.

    If a |Molecule| is initialized from an external file, the path to this file (*filename* argument) is stored in ``properties.source``. The base name of the file (filename without the extension) is kept in ``properties.name``.

    It is also possible to write a molecule to a file in one of the formats mentioned above or using the ASE.io engine. See :meth:`write` for details.

    The ``lattice`` attribute is used to store information about lattice vectors in case of periodic structures. Some job types will automatically use that data while constructing input files. ``lattice`` should be a list of up to 3 vectors (for different types of periodicity: chain, slab or bulk), each of which needs to be a list or a tuple of 3 numbers.

    Lattice vectors can be directly read from and written to ``xyz`` files using the following convention (please mind the fact that this is an unofficial extension to the XYZ format):

    .. code-block:: none

        3

            H      0.000000      0.765440     -0.008360
            O      0.000000      0.000000      0.593720
            H      0.000000     -0.765440     -0.008360
        VEC1       3.000000      0.000000      0.000000
        VEC2       0.000000      3.000000      0.000000
        VEC3       0.000000      0.000000      3.000000

    For 1D (2D) periodicity please supply only ``VEC1`` (``VEC1`` and ``VEC2``). Writing lattice vectors to ``xyz`` files can be disabled by simply reseting the ``lattice`` attribute::

        mol.lattice = []


    The detailed description of all available methods is presented below. Many of these methods require arguments that are atoms belonging to the current molecule. It can by done by using a reference to an |Atom| object present it the ``atoms`` list, but not by passing a number of an atom (its position within ``atoms`` list). Unlike some other tools, PLAMS does not use integer numbers as primary identifiers of atoms. It is done to prevent problems when atoms within a molecule are reordered or some atoms are deleted. References to |Atom| or |Bond| objects can be obtained directly from ``atoms`` or ``bonds`` lists, or with dictionary-like bracket notation::

        >>> mol = Molecule('xyz/Ammonia.xyz')
        >>> mol.guess_bonds()
        >>> print(mol)
          Atoms:

          Bonds:
           (1)--1.0--(3)
           (2)--1.0--(3)
           (3)--1.0--(4)
        >>> at = mol[1]
        >>> print(at)
                 H      0.942179      0.000000     -0.017370
        >>> b = mol[(1,3)]
        >>> print(b)
        (         H      0.942179      0.000000     -0.017370 )--1.0--(         N      0.000000      0.000000      0.383210 )
        >>> b = mol[(1,4)]
        >>> print(b)
        None

    .. note::

        For the purpose of ``mol[i]`` notation, the numbering of atoms within a molecule starts with 1. Negative integers can be used to access atoms enumerated in the reversed order (``mol[-1]`` for the last atom etc.)

    However, if you feel more familiar with identifying atoms by natural numbers, you can use :meth:`set_atoms_id` to equip each atom of the molecule with ``id`` attribute equal to atom's position within ``atoms`` list. This method can also be helpful to track changes in your molecule during tasks that can reorder atoms.

        All previously existing bonds are removed. New bonds are generated based on interatomic distances and information about maximal number of bonds for each atom type (``connectors`` property, taken from |PeriodicTable|).

        The problem of finding molecular bonds for a given set of atoms in space does not have a general solution, especially considering the fact the chemical bond in itself is not a precisely defined concept. For every method, no matter how sophisticated, there will always be corner cases for which the method produces disputable results. Moreover, depending on the context (area of application) the desired solution for a particular geometry may vary. Please do not treat this method as an oracle always providing a proper solution. The algorithm used here gives very good results for geometries that are not very far from the optimal geometry, especially consisting of lighter atoms. All kinds of organic molecules, including aromatic ones, usually work very well. Problematic results can emerge for transition metal complexes, transition states, incomplete molecules etc.

        The algorithm used scales as *n log n* where *n* is the number of atoms.

        The *atom_subset* argument can be used to limit the bond guessing to a subset of atoms, it should be an iterable container with atoms belonging to this molecule.

        .. warning::

            This method works reliably only for geometries representing complete molecules. If some atoms are missing (for example, a protein without hydrogens) the resulting set of bonds would usually contain more bonds or bonds with higher order than expected.

Using *connector* that is a part or a ring triggers an exception.
